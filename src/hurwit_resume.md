## Work Experience

```{=latex}
\firstjob{ServiceNow Cloud Observability}{Sr. Staff Software Engineer}{Feb. 2022 — Present}
```
- Led a team of six engineers to develop a net new synthetic monitoring product, growing it from concept to $10M in annual revenue.
- Provided technical leadership to 35 engineers spanning multiple teams, setting technical roadmap based on upcoming features and engineer feedback, building foundational systems that accelerated feature delivery and improved platform reliability.
- Embedded with struggling teams to diagnose performance and culture issues, driving process improvements and leadership changes that resulted in both teams meeting delivery targets.
- Served as backend lead for the dashboards product, a core Lightstep offering, defining long-term architecture that enabled customers to more effectively leverage the platform.
- Oversaw and implemented multiple tech debt remediation efforts to rearchitect system-critical components resulting in an availability increase from 3 to 5 nines and the platform hitting SLA targets.
- Redefined on-call structure and alerting standards, eliminating false positives and flapping errors, significantly reducing on-call burden while improving alert actionability.
- Designed and built a distributed queueing system, enabling product teams to offload non-time-sensitive workloads asynchronously, processing hundreds of requests per second.

\job{Drift}{Staff Software Engineer - Product}{Jul. 2018 — Feb. 2022}
```
- Led a team of four engineers to integrate an acquired ML product into Drift, designing the architecture for a real-time inference platform handling hundreds of requests per second across multiple models.
- Managed four direct reports across frontend, backend and fullstack roles, achieving 100% retention and promoting one engineer to senior level.
- Identified operational inefficiencies and optimized resource usage across all platforms, saving over $1M in AWS spend and resulting in a 2% increase in company net revenue.
- Led eight engineers to identify and harden critical platform paths, increasing MTBF by 20% through process improvements and additional fault tolerance logic.
- Created and led monthly engineering-wide forum to discuss outages and identify systemic changes to prevent future incidents and encourage open, blameless discussion of failures.
- Designed and built a globally unique ID generation system handling thousands of requests per second, enabling expansion to multiple data centers.

\job{Aurora Flight Sciences}{Junior Software Engineer}{Jul. 2016 — Jul. 2018}
```
- Built a neural network using TensorFlow and Python to classify mental workload from EEG data as part of an SBIR grant.
- Awarded patent for end-to-end development of novel gripper concept to augment robotic end effectors.
