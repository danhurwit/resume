## Work Experience

```{=latex}
\firstjob{ServiceNow Cloud Observability}{Sr. Staff Software Engineer, Remote}{Feb. 2022 — Present}
```
- Led the design and delivery of a distributed synthetic monitoring platform, owning architecture, execution, and long-term technical direction from initial concept through production scale and achieving $10M ARR in year one.
- Provided technical leadership across 35 engineers and multiple teams, setting architectural standards and influencing roadmap decisions to improve reliability, velocity, and developer experience.
- Re-architected system-critical services to remove single points of failure, improving availability from three nines to five nines and enabling consistent SLA compliance.
- Designed and implemented asynchronous processing infrastructure to decouple latency-sensitive paths, supporting hundreds of requests per second under sustained load.
- Defined on-call and alerting standards grounded in signal quality and actionability, significantly reducing alert fatigue while improving incident response effectiveness.
- Embedded with underperforming teams to diagnose technical and organizational bottlenecks, driving changes that restored delivery and reliability outcomes.

\job{Drift}{Staff Software Engineer - Product, Boston, MA}{Jul. 2018 — Feb. 2022}
```
- Led integration of an acquired machine learning system into Drift’s core platform, designing a real-time inference architecture supporting multiple models and high-throughput request patterns.
- Owned reliability improvements across critical backend services, increasing MTBF by 20% through improved fault tolerance and operational rigor.
- Drove platform efficiency initiatives that reduced infrastructure costs by $1M+ annually, directly improving company net revenue.
- Managed and mentored a cross-functional team of four engineers, maintaining 100% retention and promoting senior technical growth.
- Designed and built foundational platform primitives, including a globally unique ID generation system supporting thousands of requests per second and multi-data-center expansion.
- Established an engineering-wide outage review forum to drive systemic fixes and reinforce blameless operational culture.

\job{Aurora Flight Sciences}{Junior Software Engineer, Cambridge, MA}{Jul. 2016 — Jul. 2018}
```
- Built machine learning models using TensorFlow and Python to classify mental workload from EEG data as part of an SBIR research program.
- Led end-to-end development of a novel robotic gripper concept, resulting in an awarded patent supporting a NASA grant.
- Owned systems integration for an autonomous data-collection aircraft, working across software, hardware, and control systems.
